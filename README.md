# Wanted-Queries
 I know many of these tests don't pass at the moment. I had most of them passing, but need to work a few kinks out. 
 Hopefully you can see what I've at least attempted to do though. 
 
 Also, towards the end of writing my tests, I realized that there are a couple things I could improve to make my tests 
 and test files much more efficient. One thing I thought of was organizing my tests by each input field instead of 
 invalid category (i.e. all invalid inputs for the header field). This would allow me to verify that the correct error 
 message appears for each input field individually (DUH!).
